## Getting started

First things first, in order to work with Hugo you need to install it.
While there are multiple ways to do so, the easiest is to just download the pre-compiled binaries for your platform.

Go to: [Install Hugo](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/installing/) and follow the instructions

### A. Create Your Project

Hugo provides a `new` command to create a new website:

```bash
hugo new site my_website
cd my_website
```

### B. Install a Theme

In order to install a theme for hugo, you simply have to download the submodule inside the themes/ folder of your project

This themeâ€™s repository is: [https://github.com/526avijitgupta/gokarna](https://github.com/526avijitgupta/gokarna).

```bash
git init
git submodule add https://github.com/526avijitgupta/gokarna.git themes/gokarna
```

### C. Basic Configuration

Every hugo website has a config.toml in its home directory. Inside this file you'll find a miriad of options to configure your website

```toml
baseURL = "http://example.org/"
defaultContentLanguage = "en"
languageCode = "en"

title = "My New Hugo Site"

theme = "gokarna"

# Automatically generate robots.txt
enableRobotsTXT = true

[menu]
  [[menu.main]]
    # Unique identifer for a menu item
    identifier = "posts"

    url = "/posts/"
    
    # You can add extra information before the name (HTML format is supported), such as icons
    pre = ""

    # You can add extra information after the name (HTML format is supported), such as icons
    post = ""

    # Display name
    name = "Posts"

    # Weights are used to determine the ordering
    weight = 1

  [[menu.main]]
    identifier = "tags"
    name = "Tags"
    url = "/tags/"
    weight = 2
    
  [[menu.main]]
    identifier = "github"
    url = "https://github.com"
    weight = 3
    
    # We use feather-icons: https://feathericons.com/
    pre = "<span data-feather='github'></span>"
```

### D. Creating content

All hugo content lives inside the `content/` directory, in order to create the pages for each content type, you first need to create this folder. 

Then, inside of `content/` create a subfolder for each content type you wanna have in your website (_for this theme we have `posts/` and `projects/`_)

Lastly you need to create some content.

Lets say you wanna create a new Post, you can either create an empty `.md` file and fill it by hand, or you can use the hugo CLI:

```bash
hugo new posts/first_post.md
```

Feel free to edit the post file by adding some sample content and replacing the title value in the beginning of the file.

For posts you need to add `type: "post"` in the markdown metadata.


### E. Developing locally

Start the development server by running:

```bash
hugo serve
```

Go to `http://localhost:1313`.

### F. Building for deployment

When your site is ready to deploy, run the following command:

```bash
hugo
```

A `public` folder will be generated, containing all static content and assets for your website. It can now be deployed on any web server.

The website can be automatically published and hosted with [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/), [AWS Amplify](https://gohugo.io/hosting-and-deployment/hosting-on-aws-amplify/), [Github pages](https://gohugo.io/hosting-and-deployment/hosting-on-github/), [Render](https://gohugo.io/hosting-and-deployment/hosting-on-render/) and more...

For me, it's way easier to simply contain the source code and deploy the website to Github pages [Github pages](https://gohugo.io/hosting-and-deployment/hosting-on-github/), so i'll take this route.

## Configuration
In addition to [Hugo global configuration](https://gohugo.io/overview/configuration/) and [menu configuration](#basic-configuration), **gokarna** lets you define the following parameters in your site configuration (here is a `config.toml`, whose values are default).

```toml
[params]
  # URL for the avatar on homepage
  avatarURL = ""

  # Choose one of size-xs, size-s, size-m, size-l & size-xl. (Default: size-m)
  avatarSize = ""

  # Description to display on homepage
  description = "Sky above, sand below & peace within"

  # Accent color is displayed when you hover over <a> tags
  accentColor = "#FF4D4D"

  # You can use this to inject any HTML in the <head> tag.
  # Ideal usecase for this is to import custom js/css or add your analytics snippet
  customHeadHTML = ""

  # Keywords relevant for SEO
  metaKeywords = ["blog", "gokarna", "hugo"]

  # If you want to display posts on the homepage, the options are
  # "popular" (order posts by weight), "recent" (order posts by date)
  # or "" (do not display, default option)
  showPostsOnHomePage = ""

  # Footer text
  footer = "The Marauders"
```

### Static content

Hugo automatically serves static content that exists inside a `static/` folder in you project root directory. When you first create a hugo project, no such folder will exist, so you need to create it.

E.x. If you want to serve static images (such as your avatar), you need to create `static/images/` inside your project root directory and put inside of there your images, lets say `avatar.jpg`

Then you can reference this image from your configuration file such as:
```toml
[params]
  avatarURL = "/images/avatar.JPG"
```

## Deploying on Github
